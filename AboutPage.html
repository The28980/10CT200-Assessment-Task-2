                        <p style="color: aliceblue;">‘Big Mother’ is a social media project that hopes to help people encourage each other to live
                            healthier lives. ‘Big Mother’ gets its name from the infamous ‘Big Brother’ from 
                            George Orwell’s classic ‘1984.’ But instead of an all-seeing brother that dictates your 
                            every action, Big Mother is an all-seeing caretaker that seems petulantly insistent that 
                            you live life healthily. Through this app, you may work as an agent of Big Mother to spread 
                            propaganda about living healthily. Glory to healthy living!</p>
